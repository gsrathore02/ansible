# ansible
Ansible is a radically simple IT automation system. It handles configuration management, application deployment, cloud provisioning, ad-hoc task execution, network automation, and multi-node orchestration. Ansible makes complex changes like zero-downtime rolling updates with load balancers easy. More information on the Ansible website.

Design Principles
Have an extremely simple setup process with a minimal learning curve.
Manage machines quickly and in parallel.
Avoid custom-agents and additional open ports, be agentless by leveraging the existing SSH daemon.
Describe infrastructure in a language that is both machine and human friendly.
Focus on security and easy auditability/review/rewriting of content.
Manage new remote machines instantly, without bootstrapping any software.
Allow module development in any dynamic language, not just Python.
Be usable as non-root.
Be the easiest IT automation system to use, ever.
